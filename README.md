# 🐈‍⬛ SPACE CATS - A GAME WEB APPLICATION

## PURPOSE

_**Space Cats**_ is a game web application similar to _Newgrounds_ [1], where users can play games and view interactive art. Unlike _Newgrounds_, to play games or view art, the user does not require an account; however, to upload their work for review, they must sign up.

Ultimately, _**Space Cats**_ aims to unite people who enjoy simple and cute games.

## DEPLOYMENT

_**Space Cats**_ uses _render_ for frontend deployment [2].

# üêà‚Äç‚¨õ SPACE CATS - FEEDBACK

The feedback to the more refined / first deployed version was generally mixed: people seemed fond of the idea, but the slowness of the games drew attention.

Most of the feedback was from university colleagues [1] [2].

## BACKEND

Feedback on the front end -- especially in terms of repetitive code -- was left by a university colleague [2].

In response to the feedback, validation was added to emails and passwords.

## FRONTEND

Feedback on the front end -- especially in terms of repetitive code -- was left by a university colleague [2].

In response to the feedback, _localStorage_ was replaced by _sessionStorage_, and more components were added to use React's ability to break down code into smaller subsets.

## GAMES

The games were described as wonky, with lots of mouse scrolling and missed hits [1].

For that reason, changes were made to the canvas size for both the interactive art pieces and games.

Further feedback about the games is displayed in the image below:

# 🐈‍⬛ SPACE CATS - TESTING

A significant portion of testing for this project was carried out manually, using tools such as _Chrome Dev Tools_.

The driving force behind this decision was the lack of familiarity with _Jest_ [2] and API testing.

# 🐈‍⬛ SPACE CATS - BACKEND TESTING

Most tests for the back end use _Jest_ [2], although the _app.test_js_ file also engages in _supertest_ [3].

Writing tests for the backend proved difficult due to needing more clarity on how to write test code.

# 🐈‍⬛ SPACE CATS - FRONTEND TESTING

The front end uses the _react testing library_ [4].
